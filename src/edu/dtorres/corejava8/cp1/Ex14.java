/**
 * Write a program that reads a two-dimensional array of integers and determines
 * whether it is a magic square (that is, whether the sum of all rows, all
 * columns, and the diagonals is the same). Accept lines of input that you break
 * up into individual integers, and stop when the user enters a blank line. For
 * example, with the input:
 * 
 * 16	3	2	13
 * 3	10	11	8
 * 9	6	7	12
 * 4	15	14	1
 * (Blank line)
 * 
 * Your program should respond affirmatively.
